  <h2>Week 7 Manipulating CSS Class Properties Using JavaScript/</h2>
  <p>In the common cases where we use style rules or inline styles to affect how an element looks, the styling kicks in when the page is loaded.</p> 
  <p>There are many cases, especially as the content gets more interactive, where we want styles to dynamically kick in based on user input, 
      some code having run in the background, and more. In these sorts of scenarios, the CSS model involving style rules or 
     inline styles won't help us. While pseudoselectors like hover provide some support, we are still greatly limited in what we can do.</p>
   <p>The solution we will need to employ for all of them is one that involves JavaScript. JavaScript not only lets us style the 
      element we are interacting with, more importantly, it allows us to style elements all over the page. This freedom is very
      powerful and goes well beyond CSS's limited ability to style content inside (or very close to) itself.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p class="wow">This is a test! Change the color name in the textbox!</p>
    <form name="Form1">
      <input type="text" name="T1" value="" onchange="ChangeCSSRule('color',this.value)">
    </form>
  </body>
