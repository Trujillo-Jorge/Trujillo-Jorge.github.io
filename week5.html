  <h2>Week 5 Local Storage Storing and Retrieving Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</h2>
 <ul>
   <li><a>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</a></li>
   <li><a>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</a></li>
  </ul>
   <h3>Json Parse</h3>
    // our array
var movies = ["Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction", "Jackie Brown", 
"Kill Bill", "Death Proof", "Inglourious Basterds"];
 
// storing our array as a string
localStorage.setItem("quentinTarantino", JSON.stringify(movies));
 
// retrieving our data and converting it back into an array
var retrievedData = localStorage.getItem("quentinTarantino");
var movies2 = JSON.parse(retrievedData);
 
//making sure it still is an array
alert(movies2.length);
   <ul>
     <li><a>When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.</a></li>

     <li><a>Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Json Stringify</h3>
   <ul>
     <li><a>When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.</a></li>

     <li><a>Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().</a></li>
  </ul>
