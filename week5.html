  <h2>Week 5 Local Storage Storing and Retrieving Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</h2>
 <ul>
   <li><a>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</a></li>
   <li><a>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</a></li>
  </ul>
   <h3>Storing and Retrieving Arrays</h3>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <script>
    // our array
var movies = ["Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction", "Jackie Brown", 
"Kill Bill", "Death Proof", "Inglourious Basterds"];
 
// storing our array as a string
localStorage.setItem("quentinTarantino", JSON.stringify(movies));
 
// retrieving our data and converting it back into an array
var retrievedData = localStorage.getItem("quentinTarantino");
var movies2 = JSON.parse(retrievedData);
 
//making sure it still is an array
alert(movies2.length);
    </script>
