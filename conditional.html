    <h3>Conditional statements</h3>
      <a>Java, like all other programming languages, is equipped with specific statements that allow us to check a
condition and execute certain parts of code depending on whether the condition is true or false. Such statements
are called conditional, and are a form of composite statement.
In Java, there are two forms of conditional statements: </a>
    <ul>
      <li><a>The if-else Statement, to choose between two alternatives;</a></li>
      <li><a>The switch Statement, to choose between multiple alternatives.</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  
  <h3>The if-else Statement</h3>
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p id="ifelse"></p>
  <script>
  var month=12;
  var year=3;

if (month == 12) {
nextMonth = 1;
nextYear = year + 1;
} 
else {
nextMonth = month + 1;
nextYear = year;
}
document.getElementById('ifelse').innerHTML = nextMonth + nextYear;
  </script>
  </body>
