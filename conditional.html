    <h3>Conditional statements</h3>
      <a>Java, like all other programming languages, is equipped with specific statements that allow us to check a
condition and execute certain parts of code depending on whether the condition is true or false. Such statements
are called conditional, and are a form of composite statement.
In Java, there are two forms of conditional statements: </a>
    <ul>
      <li><a>The if-else statement, to choose between two alternatives;</a></li>
      <li><a>The switch statement, to choose between multiple alternatives.</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
