 Conditional statements
Java, like all other programming languages, is equipped with specific statements that allow us to check a
condition and execute certain parts of code depending on whether the condition is true or false. Such statements
are called conditional, and are a form of composite statement.
In Java, there are two forms of conditional statements:
• the if-else statement, to choose between two alternatives;
• the switch statement, to choose between multiple alternatives.
